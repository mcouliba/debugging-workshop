After a long and frustrated morning spending hours to solve an issue that a colleague, passing by chance with his/her 
cup of coffee, fixed in literally 5 seconds, you are finally ready to start your normal working day when ...

Your manager suddenly comes out of his/her office and walks to you with the very known face that saying *"You are in trouble!"*.
Indeed, the new release of a ***Mysterious Application*** is planned for tonight (everything is always urgent) and it seems to contain some bugs.

And of course, the developer who worked on this last release is now drinking some mojitos on the paradise island and you are the 
only one available who can save the situation. Your manager points the source code https://github.com/mcouliba/cloud-native-labs/tree/debugging[Mysterious Application^] out, 
gives you a gentle tap on the shoulder and says "Bon Courage!".

At that moment in time, you feel like you are on an island, but not the same one than your colleague.

Now you have to:

* Identify the right tools to build and run the ***Mysterious Application***
* Install them on your environment
* Build your application which could be composed by several heterogeneous languages
* Test, deploy, run it
* ...

Piouf!! Lots of things to do in a short period of time...

*"No Worry Be Happy"*, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Inc is here to help!!

=== What is Eclipse Che?

[sidebar]
--
image:{% image_path eclipseche.png %}[Eclipse Che, 400]

https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

=== Getting your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^]  will provide you an out-of-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^] uses https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/making-a-workspace-portable-using-a-devfile/[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning 
of a specific workspace by defining:

* projects to clone
* browser IDE to use
* preconfigured commands
* tools that you need
* application runtime definition

Providing a https://github.com/mcouliba/debugging-workshop/blob/master/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml^] file inside a Git source repository signals to https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che^] to configure the project and runtime according 
to this file.
====

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer Workspace'*`

[link={{ CHE_URL }}/dashboard/#/ide/{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/wksp-debugging]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::{% image_path developer-workspace-button.png  %}[Developer Workspace - Button, 300]

Then `*login as {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}*`, `*click on 'Allow selected permissions'*` and let's the magic happens...

image:{% image_path che-login.png %}[Che - Login, 500]

image:{% image_path che-openshift-authorize-access.png %}[Che - OpenShift OAuth Authorize Access, 600]

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported.

'''

=== Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift User

First, you need to connect your {{ CHE_URL }}[Che Workspace^] to the OpenShift cluster.

In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: oc login'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-oclogin.png %}[Che - oc login, 500]

[NOTE]
.Command Info
====
The command **oc login --server={{ OPENSHIFT_API_URL }}:6443** is issued using the credentials `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }}`
====

You should get an output in the **'>_ oc login' Terminal Window** as following:

[source,shell]
.>_ oc login
----
Login successful.
 
You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':
 
  * {{ PROJECT }}
    {{ INFRA_PROJECT }}
    workspaceiwml5w542l456ja7

Using project "{{ PROJECT }}".
Already on project "{{ PROJECT }}" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".
----

'''

=== Build and Deploy the Mysterious Application

Once logged, you can build and deploy the application to debug  on OpenShift.
In your {{ CHE_URL }}[Workspace^], via the command menu (Cmd+Shift+P ⌘⇧P on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+P ⌃⇧P on Windows and Linux),
`*run 'Task: Run Task...' ->  'che: oc deploy mysterious application'*`

image:{% image_path che-runtask.png %}[Che - RunTask, 500]

image:{% image_path che-ocdeployapp.png %}[Che - oc deploy the application, 500]

[NOTE]
.Command Info
====
First, the `*oc create*` command creates a list of objects defining the application. 

Then, the `*oc start-build*` commands build container images of all microservices from the local source code and deploy them on OpenShift.

This operation could take 5-10 minutes. Please, be patient :-)
====

You can observe the build and deployment progress from the {{ OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift Web Console^].

`*Access to the {{ OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift Web Console^]*`. The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. 

`*Enter your username and password ({{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}/{{ OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD }})*` and then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with.

`*Click on the {{ PROJECT }} project*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all resources composing your project.

In the left navigation menu, `*click on 'Workloads > Pods'*` to be taken to the pods overview page
which will list all pods that you have running as part of your project.

Once successfully built, deployed and runned on Openshift, **6 pods** of your application should be **Running and Ready** 
and **10 pods or more completed** as following:

image:{% image_path openshift-console-pods-1.png %}[Openshift Console, 700]
image:{% image_path openshift-console-pods-2.png %}[Openshift Console, 700]

`*Point your browser at the following application URL, http://{{ PROJECT }}.{{ APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX }}[http://{{ PROJECT }}.{{ APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX }}^]*`. 
You should be able to see the Mysterious Application up and running.
