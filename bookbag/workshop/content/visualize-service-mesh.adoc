_15 MINUTES PRACTICE_

The **Mysterious Application** in your *Developer Workspaces* is now up and running. It is composed of several components, 
but so far, you have no clue about how the application is working. Going all over this application and debugging it completely 
blindfolded is time consuming and a crazy bid as Malorie does in *Bird Box*.

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides services to get observability of applications and to understand how different components are interacting with each other.

=== What is Kiali?
[sidebar]
--
image::images/kiali-logo.png[Kiali,400]

A Microservice Architecture breaks up the monolith into many smaller pieces that are composed together. 
Patterns to secure the communication between services like fault tolerance (via timeout, retry, circuit breaking, etc.) 
have come up as well as distributed tracing to be able to see where calls are going.

A service mesh can now provide these services on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks. 
Routing decisions are done at the mesh level.

https://www.kiali.io[Kiali^] works with Istio, in OpenShift or Kubernetes, to visualize the service mesh topology, to 
provide visibility into features like circuit breakers, request rates and more. It offers insights about the mesh components at different levels, 
from abstract Applications to Services and Workloads.

=== "Kiali, please tell me, how is the application working?"

Kiali provides an interactive graph view of your namespace in real time, being able to display the interactions at several levels (applications, versions, workloads), with contextual information and charts on the selected graph node or edge.

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer Observability'*`

[link={KIALI_URL}]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::images/developer-observability-button.png[Developer Observability - Button, 300]

Then, `*log in with user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}'*`

From the **'Graph' view**, `*enter the following configuration*`:

.Graph Settings
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Namespace 
|staging-project{USER_ID}

|Graph
|Workload graph

|Edge Label
|No edge labels

|Display
|'Traffic Animation' checked

|===

The outcome is a graph with all the services, connected by the requests going through them. 
You can see how the services interact with each other.

This page shows a graph with all the microservices, connected by the requests going through them. On this page, you can see how the services interact with each other.

Even if the application *seemed* working fine, you clearly that the *Catalog PostgreSQL Service* is not a part of the graph.
That means this service is not called by the *Catalog Service* as it should be.

Let's fix it!!

'''

=== Check the Catalog Service Configuration

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Advanced (1) > Search (2)', select 'ConfigMap'(3) resource and click on 'catalog'*`

Have a look on the Data Section. *Catalog Service* is configured with the development parameters. 
Indeed, it is currently configured with an InMemory Database (H2), which is used for development purposes only.

image::images/edit-configmap.png[OpenShift - Edit ConfigMap , 900]


image::images/openshift-catalog-configmap-h2.png[OpenShift - Catalog ConfigMap H2, 900]

`*Update this ConfigMap*` with the following content:

[source,shell]
----
data:
  application.properties: |
    spring.application.name=catalog
    server.port=8080

    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://catalog-postgresql:5432/catalogdb
    spring.datasource.username=catalog
    spring.datasource.password=catalog
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.lob.non_contextual_creation=true
----

image::images/update-configmap.png[OpenShift - Update Configmap, 900]

Now, you have to re-deploy the *Catalog Service* with the latest configuration.
`*Go back to 'Topology', click on the 'DC catalog' bubble and select 'Start Rollout' action*`

image::images/openshift-catalog-rollout.png[OpenShift - Catalog Rollout, 900]

Once the application is up and running, `*refresh your browser opened on the Coolstore Application*`.
Then, `*go back on the Kiali graph*` and visualize the change.

=== CONGRATULATIONS!!!

You survive and you put off the blindfold on your own. But it is not THE END...

Now, let's go deeper!!
