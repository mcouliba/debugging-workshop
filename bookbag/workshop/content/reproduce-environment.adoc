=== What is Argo CD?

https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[Argo CD^] is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

It follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining 
the desired application state. 

It automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. Application 
deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.

=== Log in to Argo CD

`*Click on the below button called 'Developer GitOps'*`

[link={GITOPS_URL}]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::images/developer-gitops-button.png[Developer GitOps - Button, 300]

Then `*login as user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}*`, `*click on 'Allow selected permissions'*`

Once completed, you will be redirected to the following page.

=== Sync/Deploy The GitOps Application

Let's deploy the Coolstore Application into staging-project{USER_ID}!

From the **Application menu**, `*Click on 'Sync > Synchronize'*`.

[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::images/argocd-sync.png[Argo CD - Sync, 800]

This task retrieves the manifests from the GitOps Repository and performs _kubectl apply_ command of 
the manifests. Your application is now running and you can now view its resource components, 
logs, events, and assessed health status.

`*Click on your 'staging-project{USER_ID}' application*` and you should see everything in green.

=== Controlling Ingress Traffic
The Application deployed is using **Istio** (_covered in the next lab_). To be able to access the application from outside of the cluster we have to expose a specific service reachable externally, this service is called **Istio Gateway**. A Gateway allows Istio features such as monitoring and route rules to be applied to traffic entering the cluster. 
Below we will setup the Istio **Gateway** and we will configure a route (**VirtualService**) for traffic entering via the Gateway.

In the window called **'>_ workshop-tools terminal'**, `*execute the following commands*`:

=== Testing the application

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^], from the **Developer view**,
`*Select the 'staging-project{USER_ID}'*` to be taken to the project overview page.

[window=_blank, align="center"]
image::images/openshift-app-deployed-by-argocd.png[OpenShift - Coolstore Project Deployed by Argo CD , 700]

You can see that all resources of your application have been created by Argo CD. 

Then, `*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Web Service*`

Your browser will be redirect on **your Web Service running on OpenShift**.
You should be able to see the CoolStore application with all products and their inventory status.
